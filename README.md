# Weather App README

## Assignment Overview:
This assignment involves building a weather application using React.js. The purpose of this application is to provide users with real-time and forecasted weather data for their location or any location they search for. The application fetches weather data from the Tomorrow.io API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

## How to Run the Application:
To run the application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory by using `cd`.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Dependencies:
The application relies on the following external libraries and tools:
- React.js
- Tomorrow.io API for real-time and forecast weather data (make sure you login and use your own API_KEY)

## Installation Instructions:
To install the dependencies and set up the development environment:
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

## Configuration:
No specific configuration is required for this application. However, ensure you have the Tomorrow.io API key configured properly in the code to fetch weather data successfully.

## Testing:
Currently, there are no tests included with the application. However, you can manually test the functionality by running the application locally and verifying that weather data is displayed correctly for different locations.

## Issues and Troubleshooting:
- If you encounter any issues with running the application, ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly and the API key is valid.
- If the application fails to fetch weather data, check your internet connection and verify that the Tomorrow.io API is accessible.
